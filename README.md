**PLEASE NOTE**:

Private profiles and stories can **NOT** be displayed at all.

At the moment, Instagram prevents displaying more than 24 comments!

If you use this app too much, you make too many requests to Instagram and Instagram may temporarily block you for it. Then none or only a few posts can be updated or displayed and profiles cannot be shown. At this moment, please just wait for some time before using this app again. Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about it
